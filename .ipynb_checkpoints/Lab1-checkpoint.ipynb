It is easy to add new cells for these: When the cell is in _command mode_ , meaning it has a blue bar on the left rather than green. You can press `B` to add a new cell below or `A` to add it above. Also if you execute a cell with `Alt+Enter`, a new blank cell is automatically created below the current cell after executing. `Ctrl+Enter` executes without creating a new cell. \n",

When the cell is in command mode you can press `M`, otherwise you can choose Markdown form the dropdown box on the toolbar. When editing a markdown cell you can just type text. You can use Latex equations in markdown cells by wrapping them in dollar signs. For example this: ```$y = A \\omega^2 \\sin{\\theta}$``` produces:  $y = A \\omega^2 \\sin{\\theta}$. Press `Ctrl+Enter` just like with a code cell to see the markdown cell rendered.
