Their construction is an art in itself (there are 3 books just on this circuit on my bookshelf!). We will build the most basic form.\n",
    "The basic TIA circuit is as shown below. The photodiode is connected to the inverting input of an op-amp and feedback is provided by a resistor $R_f$. The non-inverting input of the op-amp is connected to ground. As photocurrent $I_p$ flows the op-amp attempts keep the two inputs at the same voltage, since one is tied to ground that voltage is zero and the inverting input becomes a _virtual ground_. In order to acheive this op-amp must cancel out the current at the inverting input. By Kirchoff's junction rule this must happen when the feedback current $I_f$ equals the photocurrent. The end result is that the op-amp output voltage will be given by: $V_o = I_p R_f$    This votlage can be measured without loading the photodiode and the virtual ground means the voltage over the diode is zero. In this way we can measure the linear photodiode output current.\n",

Note the use of the capacitors on the supply line, this removes noise from the op-amp power supply and is good practice whenever using op-amps. __Important:__ The 10$\\mu$F capacitor has a white band on it to indicate the negative leg. This must go to ground. _When incorrectly connected electrolytic capacitors can explode!_ Because we are using a single-supply op-amp there is only one way round the op-amp can go, with the annode connected to ground, this way current flows out of the inverting input and the output voltage goes positive to produce the feedback current. \n",
    "Make a brightness run measurement for the TIA as you did for the previous tasks. If you e get a completely flat-line response the most likely cause is placing the photodiode the wrong way around. Try using the same range of resistors for the feedback as you did for the load resistors in task 2. Again a 0.1$\\mu$F capacitor in parallel with the resistor will reduce noise.\n",

    "\n",
    "The TIA is the most common circuit used for working with photodiodes. Although the simple reverse bias in Task 3 also produces a linear response, the amplifier circuit when properly tuned can be far faster, allowing even nanosecond light pulses to be measured. Unfortuntely that is difficult to demonstrate without an oscilloscope. You will need to build a TIA again for later experiment."
