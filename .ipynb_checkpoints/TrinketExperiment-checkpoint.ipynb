    "# Introducing the LabTrinket\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook should help you get started using LabTrinket. As well as the Trinket M0, you will also need a 220 Ohm resistor and ideally a photoresistor or other resistive sensor to perform some of the tests in this notebook. Ideally your Trinket should also be mounted on a breadboard.\n",
    "The LabTrinket is based on the Trinket M0 microcontroller from Adafruit. It is designed to use the Tinket as a low cost component for take-home science labs allowing data gathering and some control of experiments. The Trinket is run connected to a host computer and responds to simple serial commands over USB. LabTrinket consists of two parts. \n",
    "1) A Circuit Python script to place on the Trinket microcontroller to interpret and execute serial commands from the host computer\n",
    "2) A python library for the host computer to allow it to communicate with the Trinket\n",
    "## Before using the Trinket\n",
    "To use the trinket you need to connect it via a USB cable to your computer. It is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac computers.  It should be a standard USB to micro USB as used to connect most smartphone but make sure it is not a \"charging only\" cable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up the First Time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows Drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows you will need to download and install drivers from here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino/windows-driver-installation  This step is not needed for Linux or MacOS. Follow the instructions at that link.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect the Board via the USB. You should see some LEDs flash on the board and you will notice the Trinket appears as an external drive on your computer, like a flash drive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Trinket M0 uses an onboard Python interpreter called CircuitPython. Before first use you will need to update to the latest version. Visit this section: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino?view=all#what-is-circuitpython and follow the instructions _very carefully_ to install the latest version on the Trinket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LabTrinket Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The LabTrinket client code is called \"main.py\" can be found in the \"CircuitPython\" folder of this repo. https://github.com/jhoyland/LabTrinket \n",
    "After you have updated CircuitPython and restarted your Trinket (by plugging it out and in again) you can copy main.py onto it. It will overwrite the main.py which is already on your Trinket. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Install LED Libraries\n",
    "The Circuit Python on the Trinket needs a couple of libraries to operate the on board LED. You can get hold of the complete bundle of libraries from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/tag/20200925 You probably installed CircuitPython 5 in the earlier step so get version 5 of the bundle. Unzip this somewhere convenient. \n",
    "From the bundle you need two libraries:\n",
    "```\n",
    "adafruit_dotstar.mpy\n",
    "adafruit_pypixelbuf.mpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "On your Trinket there should be a folder called \\lib  (you can create one if it's not there)  Copy the two libraries into the lib folder on the Trinket. That's the whole install for the Trinket itself. You don't need the rest of the bundle you just unzipped and it can be deleted if you want to save space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install PySerial\n",
    "\n",
    "You need one last bit of install. The base Anaconda installation does not include the serial communications package. To install, you need to start up an \"Ananconda Prompt\" - on Windows this is on the Start Menu under \"Anaconda\". There you can type: ```conda install -c anaconda pyserial```\n",
    "Follow the on screen instructions. This should install the latest version. If not using Anaconda use pip or equivalent to install pyserial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test your Trinket!\n",
    "\n",
    "With this all done you should now be able to test your Trinket. Make sure it is plugged in and mounted on a protoboard. This notebook will walk you through how to use the device. First thing to do is to import the labtrinket library and the serial library\n"
